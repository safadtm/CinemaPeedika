Alliyus Caesar, a notorious gangster and    head of the Jigarthanda Sambhavam Fans Club is Karmegam's supporter at Madurai. Jeyakodi requests    Rathna to kill Alliyus and the 3 other gangsters who are supporting Karmegam's political ambitions,    so that he can make the latter less influential within the party. Rathna selects Kirubakaran, along    with three other ex-cop prisoners, to send them as moles and assigns each of them a single target,    with Kirubakaran's target being Alliyus. Rathna promises that all four of them will be acquitted and    resumed to their duties if they succeed in their respective mission.",
    "p4": "Alliyus invites the other 3 gangsters and Karmegam for his wife, Malaiyarasi's baby shower. One of    the targets in the police' hitlist is successfully killed by one of the moles. This raises suspicion    and Alliyus finds and kills all of the moles, except Kirubakaran, as the latter is unsuspected. He   also learns that Alliyus ordered the hit on the 4 college students, for which he was made a    scapegoat. This revelation hardens his determination to pursue vengeance against Alliyus. He wants    Alliyus to be killed by Shettani, and hence asks him to visit his ancestral village and nab Shettani    with the pretext that his adventure against Shettani will make a better biopic. Alliyus unwittingly    agrees and visits the village and makes a deal with Rathna that he would nab Shettani in exchange of releasing the tribal members, to which the latter agrees."

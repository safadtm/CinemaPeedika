                <h2>Storyline</h2>
                <p>
                    1973 Kombai Village Forest: A despicable DSP Rathna Kumar is assigned to nab the notorious elephant
                    poacher, Shettani. The police torture the local tribals about Shettani's whereabouts, even though
                    they themselves are Shettani's victims. </p>
                <p>
                    1973 Madras: Kirubakaran is selected for the post of SI in the Tamil Nadu Police. He goes to his
                    fiancé, Lourde's college, to convey the news and watch her performance at the college culturals.
                    While he's talking with her, they observe a group of students fighting amongst themselves. Lourde
                    challenges Kirubakaran to stop them fighting, to which he replies that he will do that only after he
                    gets his police uniform. But, he goes ahead and tries to stop them anyway. Some time later, 4 of the
                    students are shown to be murdered by Kirubakaran, who seemingly faints at the sight of blood, but
                    has the weapon in his hand. He is then sentenced to prison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1975 Madurai: Rathna Kumar's elder brother, Jeyakodi, is a film star and rising politician of the
                    ruling party, who is ambitious and desires to be the next Chief minister. However,he is distressed
                    about his film screenings being halted in Coimbatore,Ramnad,Madurai and Tirunelveli by the
                    supporters of his fellow party member and rival Karmegam. Alliyus Caesar, a notorious gangster and
                    head of the Jigarthanda Sambhavam Fans Club is Karmegam's supporter at Madurai. Jeyakodi requests
                    Rathna to kill Alliyus and the 3 other gangsters who are supporting Karmegam's political ambitions,
                    so that he can make the latter less influential within the party. Rathna selects Kirubakaran, along
                    with three other ex-cop prisoners, to send them as moles and assigns each of them a single target,
                    with Kirubakaran's target being Alliyus. Rathna promises that all four of them will be acquitted and
                    resumed to their duties if they succeed in their respective mission.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Kirubakaran accepts the assignment as he wants to marry Lourde and get back his job. Espoused by
                    another of Karmegam's supporters during a party, Alliyus advertises publicly in search for a film
                    director who can make a pan-India film with him as the lead and introduce him as the first
                    dark-complexioned actor in Tamil cinema. Kirubakaran assumes the alias of Ray Dasan, a student and
                    assistant director of Satyajit Ray, and offers to make an Oscar-winning film based on Alliyus's
                    life, as a gangster film, titled Pandyaa, after learning that he is an ardent fan of Clint Eastwood.
                    Alliyus agrees to Ray's plan and their attempt to make a film. Kirubakaran wants to make a biopic of
                    Alliyus and does live-shooting of his real life actions using a Super 8 film camera that Clint
                    Eastwood apparently gifted to Caesar when he came for a shoot in their village. Kirubakaran learns
                    that Alliyus belongs to the same tribe that is being haunted by Shettani. It is shown that Alliyus
                    left the village as a young boy with his father due to a tragic incident and became a gangster as he
                    lost faith in being good and empathetic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alliyus invites the other 3 gangsters and Karmegam for his wife, Malaiyarasi's baby shower. One of
                    the targets in the police' hitlist is successfully killed by one of the moles. This raises suspicion
                    and Alliyus finds and kills all of the moles, except Kirubakaran, as the latter is unsuspected. He
                    also learns that Alliyus ordered the hit on the 4 college students, for which he was made a
                    scapegoat. This revelation hardens his determination to pursue vengeance against Alliyus. He wants
                    Alliyus to be killed by Shettani, and hence asks him to visit his ancestral village and nab Shettani
                    with the pretext that his adventure against Shettani will make a better biopic. Alliyus unwittingly
                    agrees and visits the village and makes a deal with Rathna that he would nab Shettani in exchange of
                    releasing the tribal members, to which the latter agrees.

                <h2>Storyline</h2><br>
                <p>
                    1973 Kombai Village Forest: A despicable DSP Rathna Kumar is assigned to nab the notorious elephant
                    poacher, Shettani. The police torture the local tribals about Shettani's whereabouts, even though
                    they themselves are Shettani's victims. <br>

                    1973 Madras: Kirubakaran is selected for the post of SI in the Tamil Nadu Police. He goes to his
                    fiancé, Lourde's college, to convey the news and watch her performance at the college culturals.
                    While he's talking with her, they observe a group of students fighting amongst themselves. Lourde
                    challenges Kirubakaran to stop them fighting, to which he replies that he will do that only after he
                    gets his police uniform. But, he goes ahead and tries to stop them anyway. Some time later, 4 of the
                    students are shown to be murdered by Kirubakaran, who seemingly faints at the sight of blood, but
                    has the weapon in his hand. He is then sentenced to prison. <br>

                    1975 Madurai: Rathna Kumar's elder brother, Jeyakodi, is a film star and rising politician of the
                    ruling party, who is ambitious and desires to be the next Chief minister. However,he is distressed
                    about his film screenings being halted in Coimbatore,Ramnad,Madurai and Tirunelveli by the
                    supporters of his fellow party member and rival Karmegam. Alliyus Caesar, a notorious gangster and
                    head of the Jigarthanda Sambhavam Fans Club is Karmegam's supporter at Madurai. Jeyakodi requests
                    Rathna to kill Alliyus and the 3 other gangsters who are supporting Karmegam's political ambitions,
                    so that he can make the latter less influential within the party. Rathna selects Kirubakaran, along
                    with three other ex-cop prisoners, to send them as moles and assigns each of them a single target,
                    with Kirubakaran's target being Alliyus. Rathna promises that all four of them will be acquitted and
                    resumed to their duties if they succeed in their respective mission. <br>

                    Kirubakaran accepts the assignment as he wants to marry Lourde and get back his job. Espoused by
                    another of Karmegam's supporters during a party, Alliyus advertises publicly in search for a film
                    director who can make a pan-India film with him as the lead and introduce him as the first
                    dark-complexioned actor in Tamil cinema. Kirubakaran assumes the alias of Ray Dasan, a student and
                    assistant director of Satyajit Ray, and offers to make an Oscar-winning film based on Alliyus's
                    life, as a gangster film, titled Pandyaa, after learning that he is an ardent fan of Clint Eastwood.
                    Alliyus agrees to Ray's plan and their attempt to make a film. Kirubakaran wants to make a biopic of
                    Alliyus and does live-shooting of his real life actions using a Super 8 film camera that Clint
                    Eastwood apparently gifted to Caesar when he came for a shoot in their village. Kirubakaran learns
                    that Alliyus belongs to the same tribe that is being haunted by Shettani. It is shown that Alliyus
                    left the village as a young boy with his father due to a tragic incident and became a gangster as he
                    lost faith in being good and empathetic. <br>

                    Alliyus invites the other 3 gangsters and Karmegam for his wife, Malaiyarasi's baby shower. One of
                    the targets in the police' hitlist is successfully killed by one of the moles. This raises suspicion
                    and Alliyus finds and kills all of the moles, except Kirubakaran, as the latter is unsuspected. He
                    also learns that Alliyus ordered the hit on the 4 college students, for which he was made a
                    scapegoat. This revelation hardens his determination to pursue vengeance against Alliyus. He wants
                    Alliyus to be killed by Shettani, and hence asks him to visit his ancestral village and nab Shettani
                    with the pretext that his adventure against Shettani will make a better biopic. Alliyus unwittingly
                    agrees and visits the village and makes a deal with Rathna that he would nab Shettani in exchange of
                    releasing the tribal members, to which the latter agrees. 

                    <!-- The villagers reveal about the importance of elephants in their culture and how they are slowly
                    vanishing from the forests due to the notorious poachers. Alliyus and the local tribals subvert
                    Shettani gang's raid and kill them, whilst also catching a few of their members. The tribal members
                    reveal the whereabouts of Shettani. Alliyus confronts Shettani, when the latter is hunting
                    elephants, and almost gets killed. Kirubakaran goes through a change of heart and saves Alliyus. He
                    takes his body to the village for treatment. Upon recuperation, Alliyus fights Shettani again and
                    hands him over to the police in the presence of the incumbent CM, who visits upon his insistence
                    that Shettani will be handed only if CM the visits the village. The villagers celebrate once the
                    inmates are released with rituals and Kirubakaran marries a local tribal woman, Paingili. As the
                    villagers celebrate the long-awaited peace, Alliyus and Kirubakaran are shocked to see Shettani back
                    in the forest hunting elephants. Shettani reveals that it is the CM-led government that has nurtured
                    him over the years so that he can smuggle ivories on behalf of two business tycoons who promised the
                    CM that they would provide her the post of Prime Minister through lobbying.

                    Shettani also reveals that the authorities have planned to label Alliyus as the real "Shettani" and
                    eventually wipe out the entire tribe in a police operation. The tribal members agree to lay their
                    lives peacefully for the greater cause and confront the police firing, which kills all of them
                    including Alliyus. Kirubakaran, who shoots the entire footage of the massacre, tries to escape with
                    Paingili and Alliyus' newborn, but they get shot in the firing. Jeyakodi is touted to be the next CM
                    candidate. Karmegam, who manages to secure video tapes of the entire film shot by Kirubakaran from
                    the crime scene, plays it in a theatre packed with the audience where Jeyakodi's film was supposed
                    to play, as a tribute to Alliyus. The audience learn about Alliyus' life and also the government led
                    massacre of the tribals and start protesting against the government.

                    The truth spreads like wildfire as it reaches across other states to the higher-ups in the central
                    government. As a final resort, the helpless CM sends Rathna and his men to kill Karmegam in the
                    theater. However, Rathna gets shocked to see Kirubakaran, who is revealed to still be alive, along
                    with Paingili and the newborn child of Alliyus and Malaiyarasi. Kirubakaran kills Rathna, while
                    Karmegam and his aides eliminate his men.

                    In post-credits scene, Kirubakaran returns home to be with Paingili and Alliyus Ceasar's child, whom
                    he names "Sethu". A mysterious man is shown stalking Paingili and Sethu. He mentions to another man
                    sitting in a car that they will eliminate the last remaining members of Alliyus' family, teasing a
                    sequel. -->
